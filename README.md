MeTube
======


The main source of video sharing in the internet is the YouTube system. Even though there are many video sharing websites YouTube is considered to be the best of all. But the only limitation we can in YouTube is that we can upload only videos files. Even though itâ€™s not a drawback, we thought why not build a system that can support audio, video and images as well. So we propose our system MeTube, which can support all the above three media.
Our system follows most of the functionalities of YouTube and in addition it has features to support all media and a place where users can share their thoughts and discuss about their favorite media i.e. a forum for them to discuss all about them. Unlike YouTube users in MeTube can add/remove friends and block people from viewing their media.
Our main intention was to build a system which is user-friendly such that people with less knowledge about the internet world can access and enjoy our system.
